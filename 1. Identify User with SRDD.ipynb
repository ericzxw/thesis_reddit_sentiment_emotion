I never post nothing on social media but tonight was the biggest peak of my anxiety and I think I had to talk somewhere I\\u2019m a 25(men) and I almost never had any relationship, I don\\u2019t think i\\u2019m looking so bad but I feel like I\\u2019m worthless and that I will always be the dude that was fun but yeah it\\u2019s a good friend you know.. I don\\u2019t know what to do anymore, dating site is the worst thing ever, I don\\u2019t see any girls at work and I\\u2019m only going out for festival, I just like to play game at home. Plus I feel like girls don\\u2019t want to be approach anymore cause they are scared which I understand..\\nI\\u2019d like to know if anyone as a good advice for me to overcome my feeling, maybe i should embrace being alone but I would just like to feel loved by some one..\\nThank you\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# The following shows the procedure of how to use regular expression formulas to identify users with SRDD from posts"],"metadata":{"id":"U6nOPVVYd7B6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# define the re formulas\n","diagnosis_pattern_v1 = re.compile(\n","    r'(?i)\\b(I was|I am|I have been|I got|I\\'m|I’ve been|I’ve got)\\s*(recently|just|previously|unfortunately|eventually|finally)?\\s*(diagnosed with|diagnosed as having)\\s*(depression|major depression|major depressive disorder|depressive disorder|clinical depression|mdd)\\b'\n",")\n","\n","diagnosis_pattern_v2 = re.compile(\n","    r'(?i)\\b(my\\s+|the\\s+|a\\s+|one\\s+)?(doctor|therapist|psychologist|psychiatrist)\\s*(recently|just|previously|unfortunately|eventually|finally)?\\s*(diagnosed me with|gave me a diagnosis of)\\s*(depression|major depression|major depressive disorder|depressive disorder|clinical depression|mdd)\\b'\n",")\n","\n","def extract_match_and_context(text, context_length=20):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    first pattern1, if not matched, then parttern 2\n","    keep 20 chars before and after the SRDD statement\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if pd.isna(text):\n","        return None, None\n","\n","    # pattern_v1\n","    match = diagnosis_pattern_v1.search(text)\n","    if not match:  # if pattern_v1 not matched, try pattern_v2\n","        match = diagnosis_pattern_v2.search(text)\n","\n","    if match:\n","        match_text = match.group()  # extract matched text\n","        start, end = match.start(), match.end()\n","\n","        # extract context words (avoid exceed the index)\n","        start_context = max(0, start - context_length)\n","        end_context = min(len(text), end + context_length)\n","        context = text[start_context:end_context]\n","\n","        return match_text, context\n","\n","    return None, None\n","\n","\n","def add_match_columns(df, content_column):\n","    \"\"\"\n","     add matched_text and context columns\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # use apply function to run extract_match_and_context\n","    df[['matched_text', 'context']] = df[content_column].apply(\n","        lambda x: pd.Series(extract_match_and_context(x))\n","    )\n","    return df\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# apply the function to dfposts\n","result_df = add_match_columns(dfposts, 'content')\n","\n","result_df\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":563},"id":"hAHIwQK9QokH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738698136144,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":12115,"user":{"displayName":"Peter Grilled","userId":"16274622982732869716"}},"outputId":"40fc1a4a-9e5c-4e80-ba4d-41a82fc03d8c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                     author  created_utc  \\\n","14378       PsychedAlex1213   1546302730   \n","14379            ellisstone   1546303472   \n","14380        Jirel-of-Joiry   1546306073   \n","14381              trefull5   1546311641   \n","14384              porky111   1546316743   \n","...                     ...          ...   \n","76133  Spiritual_Chair_7757   1704047115   \n","76134           he-likes-24   1704047605   \n","76135     Holiday-Plum-8054   1704048853   \n","76136         Itsprettydark   1704058002   \n","76137   Illustrious-Dig8915   1704058350   \n","\n","                                                   title  \\\n","14378             How do I help someone with depression?   \n","14379                               Enjoy the good times   \n","14380             Journaling - how should I go about it?   \n","14381  Welp my friends aren’t responding to my texts ...   \n","14384  Letter to the future me...
